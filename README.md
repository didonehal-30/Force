# ðŸŽ® Force

A 2D platformer game built in Unity where the player can **push and pull objects** to solve puzzles, avoid enemies, and escape traps.

## ðŸ§  Core Idea

Players use movement and **force manipulation (push/pull)** to interact with the world:
- Push: `E`
- Pull: `Q`
- Move: `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`
- Double Jump: `W` twice

Win by reaching the end of each level without dying.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Push/Pull Mechanics**: Interact with objects without touching them
- **Physics-Based Puzzles**: Stack, shift, or launch objects
- **Enemies and Traps**: Avoid or manipulate them strategically
